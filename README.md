# ERAV1_2023 Assignment S5 QnA
> This repository contains example code for classifying the MNIST dataset using neural networks. The code is implemented in Python using the PyTorch framework.

### **Files**
- **model.py**: This files includes the implementation of a neural network model for the MNIST classification, configurations for augmenting the MNIST data and functions to show the data. All data specific files are kept here.

- **utils.py**: This files contains utility functions to train, test and show model performances.

- **S5.ipynb**: This jupyter notebook provides an interactive environment for executing the code. It demonstrates the step-by-step process of loading the MNIST dataset, training the neural network models, and evaluating the classification performance and visualize the results.

### **Requirements** 

To run the code in this repository, you need the dependencies included in the requirements.txt file.

You can install using pip 
````
pip install -r requirements.txt
````
To run the jupyter notebook follow these steps:

- Clone the repository
- Choose the environment in which you have installed all the dependencies.
- Execute the code in the jupyter notebook sequentially.
- Analyze the plots generated in the notebooks to gain insight into the training process and model performance.
